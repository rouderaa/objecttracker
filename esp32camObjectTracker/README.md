# ESP32-CAM Red Object Detection

## Project Overview

This project uses the ESP32-CAM to detect red objects and offers the function `detect()` that returns the coordinates if a red object was found. A webpage is generated by this project at port 80 that allows the user to calibrate the camera levels.

## Getting Started

1. First make sure the camera is working by using the 'Start Movie' button.
2. If all is well then a real-time camera view should become visible.
3. Press 'Stop Movie' to stop.

## Calibration

1. Show a red object in the centre of the camera and then press the 'Calibrate' button.
2. In the Serial output you can see the red, green and blue levels for the centre image area.
3. Use these values as a guide to supply values for the `red_level`, `green_level` and `blue_level` parameters of the `detect()` function.

## Testing

You can test the detection by using the 'Photo' button which will draw a green square on the image where the object was detected. Resolution of the camera has been kept low in order to not overload the capacity of the ESP32 to do tracking.

## Adjusting Detection

The sliders 'Red level', 'Green level' and 'Blue level' can be used to set the detection level for the red object. Anything above red and below green and blue will be detected as a valid object.
